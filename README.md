# Mobi3-Pen
The Mobi3-Pen was designed to be as simple as possible, utilizing 3 rotation sensors to determine the end point of the pen. It features 3 clicky buttons and a usable area of roughly 1 cubic foot. 

## Build of Materials:
| Part  | Quantity | Source | Notes |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Pi Pico | 1 | [Raspberry Pi Vendor](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico) | Any Pi Pico (H, W, 2) should work. |
| Silicone Tinned Copper Wire, 30AWG | A few meters | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/cuxkzeS), Walmart, Adafruit | You can use any wire, but it needs to be flexible. Higher AWG number = Thinner, more flexible. Silicone is more flexible than plastic. |
| 608 Ball Bearing | 3 | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YKH3TDR?th=1), Bike Shops | Dimensions: 8mm x 22mm x 7mm. |
| Microswitch | 3 | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/iTHKQY7), Salvaged from old mice | The kind used in mice. Remove the switch arms if they have them. |
| A5400 Sensor Breakout Board w/ Magnet | 3 | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM3C8KFT) | Ensure magnets are 5mmx2mm and diametrically magnetized. |


## Tools Required:
- Soldering Iron and Solder 
  - This was my third soldering project. Most of the soldering is pretty simple. Make sure your solder joints are strong, as the wires will put some stress on them.
- 3D Printer and Filament 
  - Use a highly rigid filament like PLA to avoid innacuracy due to bending of arms.
